# 03- Setting Up the Development Environment

## Code editor

Using Visual Studio Code to write JavaScript.

## Node.js

Download and install Node, We do not need Node to execute JavaScript, because can use the browser to execute JavaScript. But is is good to have node installed, because we use that to install third party libraries.

## Files

Then we create a HTML file "index.html" that we are going to use as a host for the JavaScript code.

## VS Code Extension

Then install a VS Code plugin Live Server, it a very light webserver that we are going to use to serve our application.
