// 10- Operators Precedence

/*
Operators have precedence
Just like in math the expression between the parentheses "()" are evaluated first.
*/

let x = 2 + 4 * 3 // Here the * operator has higher precedence so 4 * 3 is calculates first and then add 2 so the result is 14
console.log(x)

let y = (2 + 3) * 4 // Here because we use parentheses in (2 + 4) this is calculates first and then we add 3 so the result is 20
console.log(y)
